# Resolutions

A React App which helps you keep track of your new year resolutions.

It reads data from this public [Google
spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1akhbqFlElr0iKnKmK0ZTQeNTBgvNgZVghEpDR9_MDvY/edit),
and displays a calendar for each resolution you set for yourself, highlighting
the days where you progressed (e.g. you read, you exercised), as well as the
days where you reached your weekly goal (e.g. read more than 5 days a week, or
exercise at least once every three days).

## Credits

I wanted to give React a try and was looking for something to build with it;
inspired by [LeBenLeBen/quotes](https://github.com/LeBenLeBen/quotes) I came up
this idea of creating an app to monitor the status of your new year
resolutions.
