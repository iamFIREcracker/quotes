# Resolutions

A React App that helps you keep track of your new year resolutions.

It reads data from this public [Google
spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S0exiagavqEs-mXAuZr1o_OshtWKZfVERyWRjEepsY0/edit),
and displays a calendar for each resolution you set for yourself, highlighting
the days where you progressed (e.g. you read, you exercised), as well as the
days where you reached your weekly goal (e.g. read more than 5 days a week, or
exercised at least once every three days).

You can see it action [here](https://iamfirecracker.github.io/resolutions).

## Credits

I wanted to give React a try and was looking for something to build with it;
inspired by [LeBenLeBen/quotes](https://github.com/LeBenLeBen/quotes) I came up
with this idea of creating an app to monitor the status of your new year
resolutions.
